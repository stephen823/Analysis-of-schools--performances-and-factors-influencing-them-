# pandas-challenge
In this project, I will utilize pandas to perform an in-depth analysis of data concerning a city's school district. Throughout the process, I will generate tables showing critical metrics for each school ,  each school district , top-performing schools and bottom performing schools. Furthermore, I will also conduct data manipulations to find potential factors impacting schools' performances.
